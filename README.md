### ------Aquisition of raw data----------

For recordings, we connected EEG electrodes and a 32 channel silicone probe consisting of 2 shanks with 16 channels each (NeuroNexus, A2x16-10mm-100-500-177-CM32) to two amplifier headstages (RHS Stim/Recording System, INTAN technologies) running on a Windows 10 computer. Acquired signals (both EEG and probe) were amplified in respect to a reference connected to the cerebellum ground screw, sampled at 20-25 kHz and band pass filtered between 0.2-8000 Hz.
